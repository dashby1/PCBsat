I looked into using UV light and msla 3d printers to mask PCBs to enable rapid prototyping and enable greater access/control of the manufacturing process. So far here are my thoughts:

* limited to 2 layer boards unless a good way to make multilayer boards at home is possible (kapton and copper tape?)
* Messy with Ferrite chloride etching solution, there are other possible etching solutions that are possibilities
  * Need to keep in mind accesability, ease of use, and disposeability (It's possible to recylce ferrite chloride but extra lab equipment is needed, and I'm no chemist)
* If using [uv photoresist film](https://www.amazon.com/VANTIYAUS-Photosensitive-30cmx500cm-1ftx16-5ft-Photoresist/dp/B01NCS88LU/ref=asc_df_B01NCS88LU/?tag=hyprod-20&linkCode=df0&hvadid=193160167906&hvpos=&hvnetw=g&hvrand=10154905839074515103&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9029805&hvtargid=pla-306079767565&psc=1) then storage and care should be used to not accidently pre-expose the film (non-uv emmiting lights?)

I also looked into possible OBC's to use, Possible ones to use are:

* Blueberry pi (SoC Allwinner V3s)
  * Low power consumption
  * Low speed and memory
  * Already an [open source project](https://github.com/petit-miner/Blueberry-PI) to make a 2 layer SBC from it
* Raspberry Pi zero
  * lots of documentation
  * high power consumption
  * high speed and memory
* Possibly an Arduino Mega
  * Need to look more into this one
