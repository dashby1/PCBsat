# Journal's Purpose
This folder serve as the main documentation for updates, record keeping, and notes for the PCBsat project. Each week where work was done, there will be a folder corresponding to such week with all related files and documentation recording all findings and doings (pretty mmuch everything that was done).

The structure of the journal should be as follows:
* Journal folder
  * README
  * (MM_DD-DD_YYYY)
    * Pictures
    * Notes
    * Useful Refrence Documents. [^1]

[^1]: Please note that the documents in these folders are not my own and belong to their rightful owners and incusion of them in this repository is strictly for documentation purposes.
