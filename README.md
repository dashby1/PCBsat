# PCBsat
This is a project to develop an opensource cubesat system that is highly modular by using card slot connectors. This will greatly increase customizability of cubesats and also hopefullly decrease the cost as well. The main goal is to have a low cost cubesat platform which can help people who are limited by their bank account and resources to be able to have the oppurtunity to send a cubesat to space, such as; Community colleges, Highschools, people in low income communities, individuals, etc.
##Goals
* each subsytem on a pcb will have a cardslot connector on each side, which will plug into the backside of the solar panels which will act as the bus.
* Make blank cards which will serve as a base for others to create their own modules.
* Source cheap parts which could possibly go to space.
* PCBs should provide the majority of the structural strength to minimize the need for an a structure
	* Think like a mechanism to lock each card into the bus similar to a RAM slot on a motherboard
##Progress/Support
I am a single college student with a part time job, thus progress on this project will probably be slow to say the least as time and money for me are huge constraints. I'm am currently looking into grants and other sources of funding so I can spend more time and resources to work on this project.
